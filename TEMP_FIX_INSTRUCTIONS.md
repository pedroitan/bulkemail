# Temporary Fix Instructions

## What This Fix Does

This is a temporary fix to allow the application to deploy without the missing columns in the database.
Once deployed, you can add the missing columns through a special admin route.

## How to Use

1. **Deploy this branch to Render**:
   - In the Render dashboard, update your service to use branch `temp-deploy-fix`
   - This version should deploy successfully

2. **Run the Schema Update**:
   - Once deployed, visit: `https://your-app-url.onrender.com/admin/fix-schema`
   - This will add the missing columns to your database
   - You'll see a confirmation page showing which columns were added

3. **Switch Back to Main Branch**:
   - After the schema is fixed, go to the Render dashboard
   - Update your service to use the `main` branch again
   - The deployment should now succeed because the columns exist in the database

## Technical Details

This temporary fix:
1. Comments out the column definitions in `models.py`
2. Modifies code in `scheduler.py` to work without these columns
3. Adds a special route in `app.py` to update the database schema

Once the database schema is fixed, you can switch back to the main branch with all features enabled.
